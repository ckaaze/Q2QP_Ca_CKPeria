        <hr>
        <h1>Organization Background</h1>
        <p>
            We are a volunteer-based animal welfare NGO.
            Our main work is to educate and disseminate information concerning animal welfare, animal care, animal control, and other animal-related concerns.
            <br><br>
            PAWS campaigns actively against animal cruelty and pet neglect, including activities like dogfights, horse fights, and wild animals being used for entertainment.
            <br><br>
            The Philippine Animal Welfare Society was founded in 1954 by Muriel Jay, a British educator who was then residing in the Philippines. The late Nita Hontiveros-Lichauco, one of the first volunteers, recalled that the group would make stuffed toys and other items to sell in order to raise funds. They had a clinic to treat injured animals and two bicycle patrols that picked up strays from the street.
            <br><br>
            When Muriel Jay went back to England, PAWS became less active and eventually slipped into dormancy. In 1986, Nita Hontiveros-Lichauco, who became President of the organization, reorganized PAWS with a handful of volunteers that later became the original board of Directors.

        <h1 id="header2">What the Organization has done so far</h1>
        <p>PAWS has developed programs designed to to promote humane treatment of all animals. Our 5 main programs below aim to end pet homelessness through spay/neuter (kapon) initiatives.</p>
        <br>
        <div class="list">
         <li>Clinic Spay/Neuter (Kapon)</li> <p>The PAWS Animal Rehabilitation Center (PARC) houses a veterinary clinic for low-cost spay and neuter surgeries. It is open to the public, and most especially indigent pet owners.</p>
        <li>KabaliCAT (TNR)</li> <p>TNR is the most effective and permanent way of controlling the stray cat population in your community. You can be part of the solution by working with your local government and PAWS to organize a TNR in your community.</p>
        <li>Fetch & Fix</li> <p>The PAWS Fetch & Fix Program aims to end the cycle of homelessness for the pets of people with limited means. It will allow them to take better care of their pets without worrying about accidental litters.</p>
        <li>Kapon Outreach</li> <p>Kapon outreach activities are organized with the help and cooperation of your LGU as well as sponsors who are willing to cover the cost of drugs and medical supplies as well as transportation, food and lodging of our vets and volunteers (if applicable). </p>
        <li>Kapon for All Pets</li> <p>“Kapon for All Pets” is a partnership between PAWS and participating LGUs. The program seeks to provide free or affordable kapon for pets owned by their constituents. </p>
